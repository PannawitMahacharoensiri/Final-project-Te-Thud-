Good Morning Everyone,
This project was developed as part of 01219114/01219115 Programming 1
Section 450, Academic Year 2567 at "Kasetsart University"
I am excited to present my video game project titled "Te-Thud!!!". Before I go further, I would like to acknowledge that I did not develop the original code for the game entirely from scratch. Rather, I modified and adapted existing code from a classic "Tetris" game. I would like to extend my gratitude to Christian Thompson for his contributions, which served as the foundation for this project.

You can find his original Python code at the following link:
    https://github.com/wynand1004/Projects/blob/master/Tetris%2Ftetris.py
Additionally, Christian can be found on Twitter @tokyoedtech.
Thank you for your attention, and I hope you enjoy the game!
